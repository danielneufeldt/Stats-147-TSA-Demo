# Stats-147-TSA-Demo
This is the demo code for the stats 147 final project. My chosen topic is Time Series Analysis used in the statsmodels package.

This demo uses a Kaggle dataset called AirPassengers.csv, consisting of one months column and one numeric column, and covers the following time series analysis essentials:

1) Stationary Data
2) Decompositions
3) Differencing
4) ARIMA Modeling
5) Time Series Visualizations
6) Model Validation
7) Auto-ARIMA Modeling
8) Holt Winter's Exponential Smoothing

Through this Demo, viewers should at least understand the basics of time series analysis and understand why it is useful in many industries. In addition, viewers who are unfamiliar
with time series analysis should gain a better idea of how to think about this kind of data after seeing this demo. Viewers will also gain a deeper look into more complex models at the
bottom of the code.

Thank you for viewing and have a wonderful day :)
